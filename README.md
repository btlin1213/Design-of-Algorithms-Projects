# Design-of-Algorithms-Projects
**note**: all specifications and source codes are in the respective project folder. All source codes are built on the skeleton code provided by the head tutor of COMP20007 Design of Algorithms 2020 Semester 1.

## Project 1
- Design, in pseudocode, an algorithm that evaluates arithmetic expressions that consist of integer numbers, opening and closing parentheses and the operators +, -, * and /. 
- Design and implement the following functions using an abstract data structure called **deque** where one can insert/delete from both ends.

  1. Reverse the deque iteratively.
  2. Reverse the deque recursively.
  3. Given a critical value **k**, split and rearrange the deque such that each element with a value greater than or equal to the critical value (i.e., â‰¥ k) precedes (i.e., is closer to the top of the deque) each element with a value less than k.
  
- Design and analyse an algorithm that implements Topological Sorting of given nodes.


## Project 2
- Design and implement algorithms that perform hashing and rehashing with Horner's Rule.
- Design and implement algorithms that creates, searches in, and calculates the frequency of word appearances in a character-level trie.
